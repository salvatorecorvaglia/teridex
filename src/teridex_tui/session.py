"""Database session lifecycle: connect, tear down, replace.

Extracted from :class:`~teridex_tui.app.TeridexApp`, which was the only place
that knew how to build a connection *and* the only place that knew how to
dispose of one. Keeping the two together — and away from the UI — is what makes
"open a second connection while the first is still connecting" safe: the old
session is closed rather than orphaned.
